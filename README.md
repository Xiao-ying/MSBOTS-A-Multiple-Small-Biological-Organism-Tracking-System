MSBOTS: A Multiple Small Biological Organism Tracking System Robust Against Non-Ideal Detection and Segmentation

This dataset consists of 10 video sequences with original video frames, their manually segmented ground truth (or golden standard) in each frame of the studied three types of small biological organisms, (including zebrafish larvae, Artemia and Daphnia) as well as the code for the proposed system. The original frames of each video sequence are in zipped files #.zip. 

Another 10 videos of zebrafish larvae are stored in my previouse project, https://github.com/Xiao-ying/moving-zebrafish-larvae-segmentation-and-tracking-dataset- Since sequnce 8 of zebrafish larvae is a very long video, its frames are saved in 08_part1.zip and 08_part2.zip. Please cut all the frames in one of the zipped file and paste to the other after unzip, and change the file's name with all the frames of sequence 8 to 08, after download these data.
