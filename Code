This file explains the usage of included binary and MATLAB code. Detailed information of each script is listed inside each script.


The proposed system consists of three modules: image/video background subtraction, organism segmentation and detected organism association.

(1) BackgroundSubtractionOpenCV.exe is the executable file written in C++ that you can run from command window, to do background subtraction using
the mixture of Gaussian model method. Both video and images formats accept. 
UCreateFrameFromVideo.m supplies an option to creat video frames from a video and stores the video frames of a video in a file named "VideoFrame" in the 
current folder when you run this MATLAB m file, if you prefer run images on BackgroundSubtractionOpenCV.exe. 
(1*) MATALB script UPostProcess.m do the post processing after get background subtraction results by BackgroundSubtractionOpenCV.exe. 

(2) USegmentationEvaluation.m, working together with the self-defined MATLAB function RemoveDirect.m in the same directory, 
tests the segmentation accuracy of your segmentation results comparing with the ground truth. 

(3) MyTrackBasedOnHungarianAlgorithm.m is the association/mapping module of the proposed system for the detected organisms after the segmentation module to connect the segmented organisms in current frame to their correspondences in the following frame.


The following scripts help create and check the accuracy of region-based segmentation ground-truth and centroid location based tracking ground-truth for your video frames or videos.

readPoints.m is the basic function for points selection. USelectGTPointByObject.m is the main MATLAB script for selecting centroid position based tracking ground-truth for each organism in every frame of a video. USelectGTPointByObjectEvery20Frame.m provides an option to generate ground-truth for each organism every 20 frames for an example. Only need to change the parameter of 20 if you want to change the ground-truth selection frequence.
UCheckSegmentResultProposedDataset.m conducts both fast manual and numerical (two-pass verification) verification function of the generated ground-truth images with their original images by automatically creating joint masks.


Quantitative evaluation code:
UCaculateConfidenceInterval.m calculates the confidence intervals for the set of four parameters by the folder storing the MAT results after running the USegmentationEvaluation.m program.
